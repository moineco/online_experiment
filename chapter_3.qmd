# Building blocks of apps in oTree

## App structure

1.  To create an application named **game_app** move to the oTree folder

```default
cd oTree
```

2.  Create the application

```default
otree startapp game_app
```

3.  Move to the folder **game_app**

4.  In this folder, you will find the following files as default

5.  In this folder, you will also find a sub folder

-   templates/game_app

    -   Mypage.html

    -   Results.html


## Building blocks

### init.py  

- Used to define every variable that you use in your experimet. 
- Used to determine what is showed, when,and how long

### Templates 

- Every page in your experiment is a template with text and layout

### Settings.py 

- Used to determine payoff structure and general application setting

## init.py

1.  class Subsession(BaseSubsession):

    -   pass

2.  class Group(BaseGroup):

    -   pass

3.  class Player(BasePlayer):

    -   pass

-   Pages that the participants see are defined in pages.py

    Logic for how to display the HTML templates

    when, how, and what to display

-   page_sequence gives the order of pages

    If there are multiple rounds the sequence is repeated

For instance,

1.  class MyPage(Page):

    pass

2.  class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):

    def after_all_players_arrive(self):

    pass

3.  class Results(Page):

    pass

-   page_sequence = \[MyPage, ResultsWaitPage, Results\]
