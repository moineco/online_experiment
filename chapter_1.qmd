# Installation and environments

## Install Python

- Open the python website and install python3 for your OS

- Choose the most recent version of Python

## Install Pycharm

- Open Pycharm website. There are different version of Pycharm. 

- I recommend to install the Pycharm professional because it has better syntax highlighting. To have the professional version for academic use, you need to have an academic email address.

- Alternatively you can install the community version of Pycharm which is free of charge.

- Create a new Pycharm project. Choose pure python. Give a name of the project. Pycharm will create the project for you.
