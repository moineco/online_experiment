# Installation and environments


## Install Python

- Open the python website and install python3 for your OS

- Choose the most recent version of Python


## Install Pycharm

- Open Pycharm website. 
There are different version of Pycharm. 
I recommend to install the Pycharm professional because it has better syntax highlighting. 
To have the professional version you need to have an academic email address which is from your University or institute.

- Alternatively you can install the community version of Pycharm which is free.

- Run Pycharm  

- Create a new Pycharm project. Choose pure python. Give a name of the project. And Pycharm will create the project for you
