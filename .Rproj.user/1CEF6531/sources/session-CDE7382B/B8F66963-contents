## Operationalize oTree to deploy IGG

### App

#### My first application {.unnumbered}

1.  To create an application named **game_app** move to the oTree folder

-   cd oTree

2.  Create the application

-   otree startapp game_app

3.  Move to the folder **game_app**

4.  In this folder, you will find the following files as default

-   models.py

-   pages.py

-   tests.py

5.  In this folder, you will also find a subfolder

-   templates/game_app

    -   Mypage.html

    -   Results.html

### Models.py

A model is basically a database. Here we define the structure of the data. For instance, in a three data models. This is python **class**

-   Subsession

-   Group

-   Player

1.  class Subsession(BaseSubsession):

    -   pass

2.  class Group(BaseGroup):

    -   pass

3.  class Player(BasePlayer):

    -   pass

### Pages.py

-   Pages that the participants see are defined in pages.py

    Logic for how to display the HTML templates

    when, how, and what to display

-   page_sequence gives the order of pages

    If there are multiple rounds the sequence is repeated

For instance,

1.  class MyPage(Page):

    pass

2.  class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):

    def after_all_players_arrive(self):

    pass

3.  class Results(Page):

    pass

-   page_sequence = \[MyPage, ResultsWaitPage, Results\]
