    "text": "oTree is an open-source and online software for implementing interactive experiments in the laboratory, online, the field or combinations thereof. The basic experimental setup in oTree consists of (i) an experiment written within oTree, (ii) a server computer, which can be a cloud server or a local laptop and (iii) subjects’ devices with a web browser. oTree creates an experimental session on the server, as well as links for all the participants and the experimenter.\noTree is a framework based on Python that lets you build:\n\nMultiplayer strategy games, like the prisoner’s dilemma, public goods game, and auctions\nControlled behavioral experiments in economics, psychology, and related fields\nSurveys and quizzes\n\nThis tutorial will use Python to develop the experiment by using oTree software. For Python code generation, we will use Pycharm Professional software."

You can choose the sequence.\n\nNow if you see the structure of the examples, you can see that there are various different types of folder.\nThe following two folders are known as global settings as they are same level of the project\n_Static ………Images, sounds, videos\n_Template …………Design how web page look like. If you want a specific style of your webpage, you can include a template\nsettings.py is also global option. From this setting file, you can chage various global options, for instance\n..... your currency, language, interface \nIn this setting.py file you will find the session_configs where you can"
