The basic experimental setup in oTree consists of (i) an experiment written within oTree, (ii) a server computer, which can be a cloud server or a local laptop and (iii) subjects’ devices with a web browser. oTree creates an experimental session on the server, as well as links for all the participants and the experimenter.\noTree is a framework based on Python that lets you build multiplayer strategy games, like the prisoner’s dilemma, public goods game and many other behavioral experiments in economics, psychology, and related field. This tutorial will use Python to develop the experiment by using oTree software. For Python code generation, we will use Pycharm Professional software."

    "text": "Templates\n\nEvery page in an experiment is a template with a certain lay-out and text. Templates are .html files in which you can use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Django.\n\nModels.py\n\nIn Models.py you define the variables that will be stored in your data-output. For instance, if you want to ask the age of a participant you create a variable:\nage = models.IntegerField(label=\"What is your age?\")\nHere, a model is a database table and a field is one column within that table. In this case, an IntegerField is used, indicating that only integer numbers are valid. The label determines the text that is shown to participants next to the variable. There are six StringField that you can use:\n\nIntegerField for integer numbers\nFloatField for numbers that may include decimals\nStringField for strings of text\nLongStringField for long strings of text\nBooleanField for True/False values\nCurrencyField for currency amounts\n\n\nPages.py\n\nIn Pages.py you define every page that is shown to participants and specify which variables are allocated to that page. For instance:\nclass Instructions(Page):\n    form_model = 'player'\n    form_fields = ['Comprehension1', 'Comprehension2']\nHere, Instructions is the name of the page, and form_model refers to the level at which the variables should be stored. form_fields includes a list of variables that can be elicited on the page. In this case, we include two comprehension checks that are further defined in Models.py. Next to defining and specifying variables for every page, Pages.py is also used to determine the page sequence.\npage_sequence = [Instructions, Main_Page, Results]\nMoreover, there are a battery of functions that can be used to specify conditions for each page. For example, the is_displayed() function determines conditions to which participants the page is displayed.\n\nSettings.py\n\nThe last building block of oTree is Settings.py. Here you define some overarching settings of your oTree project, such as the language used, the currency used, your admin username and password, how experimental currency translates to real-world currency, and the apps that are available. For the latter, if you have an app called attribute_substitution. You can make it available in your oTree server by typing:\nSESSION_CONFIGS = [\n    dict(\n       name='attribute_substitution',\n       display_name=\"Attribute Substitution Game\",\n       num_demo_participants=3,\n       app_sequence=['attribute_substitution']\n    ),\n]\nHere, the name and display name are whatever you prefer (for name you cannot use spaces). The number of demo participants is the number of slots available to play a demo version of the experiment. The most important thing here is the app_sequence. In the app_sequence you define the sequence of apps that is displayed to participants. Suppose that you want to combine the attribute_substitution app with a public goods game or a survey, you can add, public_goods or survey, respectively."

We use Heroku which is a cloud hosting server that provides a platform for apps where you can easily host your oTree application and open access to the public.\nIf you run an experiment with a substantial number of participants, you must upgrade to a paid server. As you can immediately scale the server capacity it is not expensive to use. For instance, if you run your experiment in the timeframe of three days, you only pay 3/30th of the monthly fees as you scale it up before you use it and scale it down after you use it. After you have created an account on Heroku, download and install the Heroku CLI. After installing the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI), there are three ways to deploy experiments to Heroku:"

However, convenience comes at a cost as you can have limited free project space and everything you deploy using oTree Hub becomes publicly available immediately, unless you pay.\n\n\n5.1.2 GitHub\nGitHub also does not require programming and you can even auto-deploy your experiment every time you commit changes to GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you can integrate this with Heroku. In Heroku, create an app and click on “Deploy”. Here, you can authorize Heroku to access your GitHub repositories. After authorizing Heroku, you can search for your GitHub repository and connect it to Heroku. You can either manually deploy your GitHub repository to Heroku or automatically deploy all pushes you make to GitHub. If you add new variables in your experiment, you should reset the database in Heroku by using the following code in the Command Prompt.\nheroku login\nheroku run \"otree resetdb\" --app your_appname\n\n\n5.1.3 Terminal\nYou can use the command line (or Terminal for iOS users) to deploy your experiment to Heroku. In this case, you do not need any third-party software except Heroku. To use the command prompt you need to follow the following steps:\n\nLocate the project root folder (particular oTree instance).\n\ncd '/Users/Name/Folder/'\n\nIf you have created a Heroku account, use the following command. If you do not have a Heroku account yet, you can create one here.\n\nheroku login\n\nIf the above command does not work, you probably have not installed Heroku CLI properly.\nThen, you can create a new Heroku-app, if you don’t have one yet.\n\nheroku create your_appname\n\nSince you are already in the project root folder you can create the .git here.\n\ngit init\nheroku git:remote -a your_appname\n\nYou can push your code locally to Heroku. Finally push the local repository to the Heroku server.\n\ngit push heroku master\n\nIn order to view the Heroku app, enter the following command or enter the URL in your browser.\n\nheroku open\n\nIf you add new variables in the models.py, you should reset the database in Heroku.\n\nheroku login\nheroku run \"otree reset db\" --APP your_appname\n\nOr do it manually in the Heroku app, simlarly to the way described earlier."
