A project is collection of all different types of App\n\n- If your experiment consist of a prisoner's dilemma game and a survey, then you need to create two apps, one app for prisoners dilemma and another app is for survey.\n\n- Later you can combine these two apps and run one session.\n\n- App is like one experiment and project is like a container of different experiments.\n\n- How you structure the projects is up to you. You can choose the sequence.\n\n\nNow if you see the structure of the examples, you can see that there are various different types of folder.\n\nThe following two folders are known as global settings as they are same level of the project\n\n\n _Static .........Images, sounds, videos\n\n _Template  ............Design how web page look like. If you want a specific style of your webpage, you can include a template\n\n settings.py is also global option. From this setting file, you can chage various global options, for instance \n\n    ..... your currency, language, interface \n\nIn this **setting.py** file you will find the session_configs where you can \n\n\n## How to create a new app.\n\n- Navigate your working folder by using cd\n For instance you are using the folder **myproject**.\nThen use \n\n> cd myproject \n\nto navigate in this folder\n\n- Now you can create a new app from the terminal. \n\nIf you want to create a app, name \"testapp\"\n\n> tree startapp testapp\n\n- You will notice that a new app named \"testapp\" is listed on your pycharm\n- If you open the app, you can see that it contains three different types of files:\n\n    -- _init__.py\n    --  MyPage.html\n    --  Results.html\n\nIf you open the --init__.py you can find several different class.\n\nYou can edit it based on your game\nTwo most important classes are\n \n- class Constants\n- class Player. Everything we want to analyze and store in data should be stored in Player\n\n \nHtml files are to design the outlook of website\n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"chapter_2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"chapter_2.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
