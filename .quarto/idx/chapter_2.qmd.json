A project is collection of all different types of App.\n\n- If your experiment consist of a prisoner's dilemma game and a survey, then you need to create two apps, one app for prisoners dilemma and another app is for survey.\n\n- Later you can combine these two apps and run one session.\n\n- App is like one experiment and project is like a container of different experiments.\n\n- How you structure the projects is up to you. You can choose the sequence.\n\n- Now if you see the structure of the examples, you can see that there are various different types of folder.\n\n- The following two folders are known as global settings as they are same level of the project\n\n> _Static \n \n  - Images, sounds, videos\n\n> _Template\n\n  - Design how web page look like. If you want a specific style of your webpage, you can include a template\n\n>settings.py \n\n  - It is also global option. From this setting file, you can change various global options, for instance  Your currency, language, interface \n\n  - In this **setting.py** file you will find the session_configs where you can setup the sequence of apps for your project.\n\n\n## How to create a new app.\n\n- Navigate your working folder by using **cd**\n\n- For instance you are using the project **IGG**. Then use \n\n```default\ncd IGG \n```\n\nTo navigate in this folder\n\n- Now you can create a new app from the terminal. \n\nIf you want to create a app, name \"SVO\"\n\n```default\notree startapp SVO\n```\n\n- You will notice that a new app named \"SVO\" is listed on your Pycharm\n\n- If you donâ€™t see a models.py in each folder, that means you are using the new no-self format.\n\n- If you open the app, you can see that it contains three different types of files:\n\n    - init.py\n    \n    - MyPage.html\n    \n    - Results.html\n\nIf you open the **init.py** you can find several different class.\n\nYou can edit it based on your game. Two most important classes are:\n \n- class (Constants)\n- class (Player)\n\nEverything we want to analyze and store in data should be stored in Player.\n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"chapter_2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"chapter_2.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
