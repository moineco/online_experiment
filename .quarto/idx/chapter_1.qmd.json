We recommend you to use PyCharm if you want to further customize your oTree app by programming. Please go to this [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) website to download the installation package.\n\n-   There are different version of Pycharm. I recommend to install the Pycharm professional because it has better syntax highlighting. To have the professional version for academic use, you need to have an academic email address.\n\n-   Alternatively you can install the community version of Pycharm which is free of charge.\n\n### Run Pycharm\n\n-   Create a new Pycharm project. Choose pure python. Give a name of the project. Pycharm will create the project for you.\n\n## Install GitHub\n\nMake sure you have some kind of version control, I use GitHub. If you crash your code, you can always go back to a previous version of the code.\n\n## Install oTree\n\n-   oTree can be installed through pip. Open the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows PowerShell) and type:\n\n``` default\npip3 install otree\n```\n\n-   You can install oTree in your computer by using the terminal in Pycharm as well.\n\n``` default\npip3 install otree\n```\n\n### Upgrading/reinstalling oTree\n\n``` default\npip3 install -U otree\n```\n\n-   Recommend upgrading every couple of weeks.\n\n### Regarding the installation of oTree in Linux\n\n-   You might need to do the proxy server settings\n\n-   In the Pycharm, you can open the terminal and install oTree as below:\n\n``` default\nset https_proxy address:password\npip install otree\n```\n\n## oTree setup\n\n-   From your command prompt, create your **IGG** project\n\n``` default\notree startproject IGG\n```\n\n-   Move into the folder you just created\n\n``` default\ncd IGG\n```\n\n-   Run the server\n\n    Start your own terminal as a server.\n\n``` default\notree devserver\n```\n\n-   Open your browser to http://localhost:8000/. You should see the oTree demo site.\n\n-   To stop the server, press **Control+C** at your command line.\n\n-   To create a new app, run\n\n``` default\notree startapp app_name\n```\n\n-   Session configs are defined in **settings.py**\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"chapter_1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"chapter_1.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
