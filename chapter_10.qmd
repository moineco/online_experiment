# Questionnaire survey with oTree

## Outline of the experimental program to be created:

- Questionnaire (single player)
    - Question item
       - Gender (radio button)
       - Age (optional)
       - Prefecture of residence (optional)
       - Device used for answering (select)


## Create an app
Create a base application

```default
otree startapp questionnaire
```

### Defining the Constants class: basic design

- Open models.py in questionnaire folder

- Set the number of people, the number of repetitions, the initial holding amount, and the coefficient in the Constants class.

```default
class Constants(BaseConstants):
    name_in_url = 'questionnaire'
    players_per_group = None 
    num_rounds = 1 
```
Notes: 

- For `players_per_group`, enter "None" for 1 player. 

- For `num_rounds`, enter "1" to ask only once.

- `names_in_url`, `players_per_group`, `num_rounds` are defined on oTree, so it is not desirable to use them as arbitrary variable names
